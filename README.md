# Blast Data Platform
This repo is used to store the docs for Blast data platform.

## Adding/modifying docs
The docs site is powered by [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy), therefore you need to install their CLI first:

```
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Once the installation is completed, you can run the docs locally:
```
docsify serve docs
```

## Structure
The `docs` folder is where the documentation is stored. Underneat that folder, any new file will be a page on the sidebar, and the content of the file will be displayed when the file is opened. Please follow [the docs on the Docsify website](https://docsify.js.org/#/more-pages) for more details about how to structure the Markdown documents.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit a PR to improve the docs.
